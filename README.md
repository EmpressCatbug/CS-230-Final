 The Gaming Room client sought to expand their game, "Draw It or Lose It," to a multi-platform ecosystem including web-based applications accessible across Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android. They aimed for a server-side configuration to support thousands of players, emphasizing scalability, cross-platform compatibility, and a seamless user experience.

In developing the documentation, I excelled at analyzing and presenting a comprehensive evaluation of each platform's suitability for hosting and development, including cost considerations and development tools. This thorough analysis helped in making informed recommendations to the client.

The process of working through the design document was beneficial as it provided a structured approach to systematically address the client's requirements. This structured approach helped in ensuring that all critical aspects of the software development, including server-side deployment, licensing costs, client-side development, and cross-browser compatibility, were thoroughly considered and documented.

If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the section on development tools and languages. I would delve deeper into comparing the strengths and weaknesses of various programming languages and development environments specific to each platform. This improvement would provide the client with more detailed insights into choosing the most efficient tools for their project.

Interpreting the user's needs involved closely analyzing the client's goals for scalability, accessibility, and seamless gameplay across diverse devices. Considering the user's needs is crucial because it ensures the software design aligns with user expectations and requirements, ultimately leading to a more engaging and satisfying user experience.

My approach to designing software began with understanding the client's objectives and user needs, followed by evaluating the technical and operational requirements of the project. In the future, I would continue to employ a methodical approach, utilizing design patterns and best practices, while also incorporating rapid prototyping and user feedback early in the design process to ensure that the final product closely aligns with user expectations and business goals.
